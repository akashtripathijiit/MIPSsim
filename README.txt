MIPS simulator - Python

Please find attached 'Desciption' file
I thank my Pofessor, Prabhat Mishra for the specifications provided for the class project.
I have implemented the same implementation using python here.

disassembly.txt and simulation.txt are the expected output files for the input sample.txt.
and there is a MIPS reference file attached as well.
